## üßÆ Mathematical Background

### What are Activation Functions?
Activation functions are mathematical functions that determine the output of a neural network node. They introduce **non-linearity** into the network, which is crucial for learning complex patterns.

### Why Non-linearity Matters
Without activation functions, neural networks would be limited to learning only linear relationships. Non-linear activation functions enable networks to:
- Learn complex patterns and decision boundaries
- Approximate any continuous function (Universal Approximation Theorem)
- Solve real-world problems like image recognition and natural language processing

### Function Characteristics

| Function | Range | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|----------|-------|------------|---------------|
| Sigmoid | (0, 1) | Smooth, probabilistic output | Vanishing gradients |
| Tanh | (-1, 1) | Zero-centered, smooth | Vanishing gradients |
| ReLU | [0, ‚àû) | Simple, fast, avoids vanishing gradients | Dead neurons |
| Leaky ReLU | (-‚àû, ‚àû) | Prevents dead neurons | Requires tuning |
| Swish | (-‚àû, ‚àû) | Self-gated, smooth | More computationally expensive |
| GELU | (-‚àû, ‚àû) | Smooth, probabilistic | Complex computation |
| ELU | (-Œ±, ‚àû) | Smooth, negative outputs | Exponential computation |
